### Concept:

In the cyberpunk future, people can add more time to their lifespan by earning tokens called a toki (æ™‚). It was first introduced in the year 2056, and quickly became a new global currency alongside the EuroDollar (eddie).
#### Rates:

1 toki = 2 months of more life-span
1 toki = 190 eddies
  
People can earn tokis through one of two ways:

- Buy tokis with Eddies
- 1 toki = 12 hrs of completing tasks on the super popular CLI app, **Zaman**

## How does the app work?

- User complete certain tasks and depending on the nature of the task, the user can earn tokis. It is like a guild system.

## How to run the app?
